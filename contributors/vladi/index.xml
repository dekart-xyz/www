There are few reason why you need Admin Boundaries in your Data Analysis:
Your data does not have explicit coordinates or geometries but has reference to Countries, States, Counties or Zip codes Admin Boundaries (like city boundary) presents a meaningful way to clip your data for analysis. You want to perform analysis per admin geography (like number of new COVID cases per state/ per capita) There are platforms which allow you to enrich your data with Admin Geometries, but then you lose all power of filtering and aggregation with BigQuery SQL.</description></item></channel></rss>
