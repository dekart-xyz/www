There are few reasons why you would need Admin Boundaries in your Data Analyses:
Your data does not have explicit coordinates or geometries but has references to Countries, States, Counties or Zip codes Admin Boundaries (like city boundary) presents a meaningful way to clip your data for analysis. You want to perform analyses per admin geography (like number of new COVID cases per state/capita) There are platforms which allow you to enrich your data with Admin Geometries, but then you lose all the power of filtering and aggregating with BigQuery SQL.</description></item></channel></rss>
