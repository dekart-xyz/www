There are few reason why you need Admin Boundaries in your Data Analysis:

You want to perform analysis per admin geography (like number of new COVID vases per state/ per capita) There are platforms which allow you to enrich your data with Admin Geometries, but then you lose all power of filtering and aggregation with BigQuery SQL.</description></item></channel></rss>
