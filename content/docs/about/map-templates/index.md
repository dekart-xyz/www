## What is a Map Template?

A Map Template is a reusable Dekart Map that you can use as a starting point for your analytics projects. Each Map Template is designed to help you quickly visualize your data and answer common business questions. Map Templates utilize Dekart's query parameters to make it easy to customize the map to your specific needs.

### OSM vs Overture Maps – Compare Bike Lane Coverage

{{< img src="62130325-9fc7-4687-ac05-52f6b7513502.png" template="62130325-9fc7-4687-ac05-52f6b7513502" >}}

This template lets you visualize and compare bike lane coverage in any city by pulling data from both OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Overture Maps. Simply choose a city (and country code) to see which streets have dedicated cycle paths—and whether certain lane tags (like cycleway:left) appear in one dataset but not the other. It’s ideal for data analysts, urban planners, or anyone curious about how well bike lanes are mapped in their area.
