## **Introduction**

This Terms of Service Agreement ("Agreement") governs the access and use of software and services ("Service" or "Services") provided by Dekart XYZ UG ("Dekart", "we", "our", or "us"). By purchasing or subscribing to "Dekart On-Premise Premium" or "Dekart Premium Lifetime License" ("License"), you agree to be bound by the terms in this Agreement.

## **License Grant and Scope**

### **On-Premise Premium Subscription**
- Customers subscribing to the "Dekart On-Premise Premium" will receive access to the software source code under a commercial license, including any additional features provided exclusively under the subscription model.
- The commercial license remains valid as long as the subscription is active. If canceled, access to future updates, features, and support will be terminated at the end of the billing cycle.
- The subscription grants commercial use rights under this Agreement until the customer cancels or the subscription is terminated by Dekart.

### **Premium Lifetime License**
- Customers who purchase the "Dekart Premium Lifetime License" are granted a perpetual commercial license, even if they later cancel their subscription to "Dekart On-Premise Premium".
- However, they will not receive updates or support once they cancel the subscription.

### **Commercial License Terms**
- The commercial license allows customers to modify, distribute, sublicense, and resell the provided code, subject to ongoing compliance with the terms.
- The license is non-exclusive and is provided "as is," without warranties, express or implied.
- The customer retains ownership of any customizations or derivative works they create using the code.

## **License Restrictions**
- Access to the provided source code is limited to a maximum of three employees per customer. Additional accounts can be purchased.

- The customer may not use the software to build a product that directly competes with Dekart or violates any legal or ethical standards.

## **Support and Maintenance**
- As part of the "On-Premise Premium" subscription, customers will receive monthly updates, including security patches to address critical, high, and moderate vulnerabilities, as identified by GitHub's Dependabot or similar tools.
- Customers who cancel their subscription will no longer receive any updates, including security patches.
- Support can be provided via Slack or similar platforms, subject to reasonable limitations defined in a separate support agreement. Monthly 30-minute orientation calls with Dekart maintainers are available on request.

## **Termination**
- Dekart reserves the right to terminate any subscription with 30 days' notice, after which service and support will continue until the end of the billing period. Dekart may also terminate the agreement immediately for breach of terms or misuse of the service.
- If a customer cancels mid-billing cycle, no refunds will be provided.
- The customer must provide accurate and current contact and billing information. Any disputes regarding charges must be communicated within 30 days of the charge date.

## **Intellectual Property**
